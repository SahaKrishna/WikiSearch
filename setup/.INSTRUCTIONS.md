# Technical Test

## Description

This is a technical test designed as part of an interview process for The Scale
Factory.  It's an "open book" exercise, designed to look like a general
consultancy engagement.  As a result, you're free to use whatever online
resources you need, though we recommend against having an IRC buddy helping
you through the whole thing unless they're also looking for a job ;)

One of us will be available via a Zoom shared screen session, or next to you in
the office, and you can ask us questions if you need to.

We'll be taking the place of the customer, and you can interact with us on that
basis.

## The Test

You're visiting a customer, they've a start-up and their developers have
hacked together a prototype app. They would like us to investigate their setup
and suggest some improvements.
